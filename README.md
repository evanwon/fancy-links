# Fancy Links
Fancy Links is a browser extension that transforms plain URLs into friendly links with included page titles. Perfect for sharing in chat apps, Reddit, GitHub, documentation, and anywhere formatted links look better than bare URLs.

**Browser Support:**
- [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/) (minimum version 109)

Interested in other browsers? Please vote for [Chrome support](https://github.com/evanwon/fancy-links/issues/15) or [suggest a new browser](https://github.com/evanwon/fancy-links/issues/new/choose)!

## Development Guide

### Local Development

#### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/evanwon/fancy-links.git
cd fancy-links

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install web-ext globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g web-ext
```

#### Development Commands
```bash
# Run in development mode (hot reloads on changes)
web-ext run --source-dir=src
# Or use npm script:
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # Coverage report

# Lint and build
npm run lint:firefox     # Check for issues
npm run build            # Build .zip file
npm run build:firefox    # Lint and build
npm run test:build       # Test, lint, and build
```

### Testing in your regular browser 
If you want to run local builds of the extension in your regular browser (not the sandbox test browser), you can install it for your current browsing session by following these instructions:

1. Build the `.xpi` as shown above, or download the latest `.xpi` file from [Releases](https://github.com/evanwon/fancy-links/releases).
2. Open Firefox and navigate to [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. Select the downloaded `.xpi` file

Note that using this `about:debugging` approach will only load the plugin for your current session.

### Debugging with VSCode
This project includes VSCode debugging configuration for the [Debugger for Firefox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firefox-devtools.vscode-firefox-debug) extension.

#### Prerequisites
1. Install the "Debugger for Firefox" extension in VSCode if not already installed

#### How to Debug
1. Open the project in VSCode
2. Press `F5` or go to Run and Debug panel (`Ctrl+Shift+D`)
3. The default "Debug Fancy Links (Auto-Reload)" configuration will:
   - Start Firefox with the extension loaded
   - Automatically reload the extension when you save changes
   - Allow you to set breakpoints in any JavaScript file

#### Available Debug Configurations
- **Debug Fancy Links (Auto-Reload)** (default): Best for development - auto-reloads on file changes
- **Debug Fancy Links**: Basic debugging without auto-reload

#### Tips
- Breakpoints work in all extension scripts (background, popup, content scripts)
- Use the Debug Console to execute commands in the extension context

### Testing

#### Manual Testing
1. Run `web-ext run --source-dir=src` to start development Firefox
2. Open `test/manual.html` for comprehensive testing scenarios
3. Test all format buttons and keyboard shortcut


### Release Process

#### Setup for AMO Submission (one-time)
1. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets):
   - `AMO_API_KEY`: Your AMO API issuer ID
   - `AMO_API_SECRET`: Your AMO API secret

2. **Configure GitHub Variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables):
   - `AMO_SUBMISSION_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable automatic AMO submission on tags

#### Automatic Release (via git tag)
Releases are automatically built and optionally submitted to AMO when you push a version tag:

```bash
# 1. Update version in src/manifest.json
# 2. Commit changes
git add -A && git commit -m "Version X.Y.Z"

# 3. Create and push tag (triggers GitHub Actions)
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The workflow will:
- Run tests and linting
- Build the extension
- Create a GitHub release
- Submit to AMO (if `AMO_SUBMISSION_ENABLED` variable is `true`)

#### Manual Build (via GitHub Actions)
For testing builds without creating a release:

1. Go to [Actions tab](../../actions)
2. Select "Build and Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure options:
   - `create_release`: Create GitHub release (default: false)
   - `submit_to_amo`: Submit to AMO (default: false)
   - `channel`: AMO channel - `listed` (public) or `unlisted` (self-distribution)
5. Click "Run workflow"


### Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly with `web-ext run --source-dir=src`
5. Commit: `git commit -m 'Crisp, specific definition of your change'`
6. Push: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. Open a Pull Request

### Development Notes
- Uses **Manifest V2** (Firefox still prefers MV2 over MV3)
- **No external dependencies** - pure HTML/CSS/JS
- **Modular architecture** for easy format addition
- **Browser-compatible format system** (avoids Node.js require() issues)
- **Clean separation** between extension code (`src/`) and development files
- **Comprehensive sanitization** prevents XSS and format-breaking

### Permissions
- `clipboardWrite`: Copy formatted text to clipboard
- `activeTab`: Access current tab's title and URL
- `storage`: Save user preferences
- `notifications`: Show copy confirmation messages

## Acknowledgments
Developed using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), but don't worry, I included `please bro, no mistakes` multiple times in the prompt.

(In seriousness, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to try out Claude Code-first development. At least at the start of this project, I'm trying to primarily use Claude Code, and I included `CLAUDE.md` in the repo so you can see how I'm trying to guide the tool. For any Claude-driven commits, Claude will note itself as a co-author in the commit message. I'm still intervening quite a bit and haven't yet been bold enough to set it in full-auto mode, but maybe we'll get there eventually.)
